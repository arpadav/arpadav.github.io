    <p>Round like a circle in a spiral
Like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending nor beginning
On an ever spinning reel

Like a snowball down a mountain
Or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning
Running rings around the moon

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
Past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space

Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind

[Verse 2]
Like a tunnel you can follow
To a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern
Where the sun has never shone

Like a door that keeps revolving
In a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble
Someone tosses in a stream

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
Past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space

Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind

[Verse 3]
Keys that jingle in your pocket
Words that jangle in your head
Why did Summer go so quickly
Was it something that you said?

Lovers walk along a shore
And leave their footprints in the sand
Was the sound of distant drumming
Just the fingers of your hand?

Pictures hanging in a hallway
Or the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces
But to whom do they belong?

When you knew that it was over
Were you suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning
To the colour of her hair

[Conclusion]
A circle in a spiral
A wheel within a wheel
Never ending nor beginning
On an ever-spinning reel

As the images unwind
Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind</p>
