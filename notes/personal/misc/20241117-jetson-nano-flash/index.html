In case I forget.<p>I was struggling with flashing my old NVIDIA Jetson Nano Development Kit after moving from a slow microSD card (which made it difficult to perform tasks) to a newer / faster one. However, since the old one was traditionally flashed out-of-the-box using the microSD card (<a href=https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit>following the official NVIDIA tutorial</a>, I could apparently not simply re-flash the microSD card and repeat the process.)<p>I have to put the Jetson Nano into recovery mode and connect to a Linux machine to reflash. There are two options:<ol type=1><li><a href=https://docs.nvidia.com/jetson/archives/r34.1/DeveloperGuide/text/SD/FlashingSupport.html>Use the CLI for granular flashing (advanced)</a>. Note that you need to find and download the correct <code>Linux for Tegra</code> source <strong>for the Jetson Nano</strong> in order to find the proper flashing scripts. E.g. (not guaranteed to work for Jetson Nano) <a href=https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/linux-tegra-r2821><code>Tegra-R2821</code></a><li><a href=https://developer.nvidia.com/sdk-manager>Use NVIDIA SDK manager (beginner)</a></ol><p>I went with option (2) since I have never done this before, and it was difficult to read NVIDIA's documentation as a beginner in this space.<h2 id=get-nvidia-sdk-manager>Get NVIDIA SDK Manager</h2><p>See: <a href=https://developer.nvidia.com/sdk-manager>https://developer.nvidia.com/sdk-manager</a><p>Need to login / create an NVIDIA account to get the <code>.deb</code> file. E.g. <code>sdkmanager_2.2.0-12021_amd64.deb</code><h2 id=put-jetson-nano-into-recovery-mode>Put Jetson Nano into Recovery Mode</h2><p>A physical pin needs to be bridged to ground to enter, what is known in the embedded world as, "recovery mode". This essentially means the device's firmware is able to be overwritten.<p>On the Jetson Nano Development Kit, this is found on the Button Header [J50]. The silkscreen on the bottom of the board should show pins 3/4 which need to be jumped. Different versions of the carrier board and different Jetsons have this pin in different locations, so please check other pin-out diagrams online.<figure><img alt=jetson-nano-dev-kit-pinout src=pinout.png><figcaption aria-hidden=true>jetson-nano-dev-kit-pinout</figcaption></figure><h2 id=other-jetson-nano-peripherals>Other Jetson Nano Peripherals</h2><ol type=1><li>Required: Ethernet (for SDK components)<li>Optional: Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor</ol><h2 id=run-nvidia-sdk-manager-from-ubuntu-18.04>Run NVIDIA SDK Manager from Ubuntu 18.04</h2><p>This needs to be run inside of Ubuntu 18.04 in order to flash the Jetson Nano directly.

Otherwise, "Automatic" mode works fine if the device is powered on and plugged in.<p><img src=sdks3.png><p>Can plug in monitor while being flashed for sanity. The NVIDIA logo with white background should appear upon completion. This screen will also show up:<p><img src=components.png><p>Hold off on installing until the configs on the Jetson are installed and it is rebooted (this is when you select <code>Pre-config</code> and you can verify the automatic config if plugged into monitor).<p>Once the Jetson reboots and it is in the login screen, the device has been flashed! <strong><em>Remember to remove the recovery mode jumper pin prior to flashing</em></strong><p>It will prompt to install the SDK components. Try SSH'ing into it on another terminal. The IP, Username, and Pwd were all set within the SDK manager. Only after ssh works and confirmed, press <code>Install</code>. Given the <code>distrobox</code> deps which were installed in the <code>distrobox</code> provisioning part, this should yield no error and:<p><img src=components-install.png><p>This will just repeatadly ssh into the Jetson Nano and install essentials like CUDA, OpenCV, some DL stuff, etc. This step can be skipped, but not recommended.<h2 id=debugging>Debugging</h2><p>Note that if you run into any errors, please see the terminal output for an easy way to debug what is actually going on:<p><img src=dbg.png><p>In the image above, you see it can't find <code>nc</code> which can be installed using <code>sudo apt install netcat</code> on my <code>distrobox</code> instance. It could have just directly ssh'ed, but it said it failed because of a missing dependency.<p>Lastly, if there are any issues during ANY part of this, save the logs or view the terminal output and review. It is likely dependency issues where you will have to re-flash after installing them, or verifying an internet connection.</div><base target=_top></div><link href=/css/std.css rel=stylesheet>
