Meaning, given a GPS/GNSS antenna connected to it (or, most have one built-in), you can say "look at this Lat/Lon", and given the camera intrinsics + extrinsics, it can figure out where how much to pan/tilt to center that position.

But can discuss them - AAV<p>Note that these all depend on your modality of data. E.g. SAR can see through moisture and many atmospheric artifacts, but is very rough (visually) in its current state for UAV's (turbulence, de-speckling, filtering, all factor a role). In addition, MSI/HSI can do more refined <strong>identification</strong> rather than <strong>classification</strong> (e.g.Â "it is ship A" rather than "it is a ship").<p>All are best when done on the edge. Downlink of data and then processing helps with compute, but you are susceptible to latency on decision making, compression artifacts, etc.<ul><li>Detectors<li>Classifiers<li>Detector-classifiers (combined)<li>Trackers <ul><li>Accounting geodesic information for 3D, world-space, tracking. Rather than pixel-based</ul><li>Path planning (platform) <ul><li>Accounting for no-fly-zones<li>For some sensors like SAR, a specific geometry is required for the platform to maneuver to capture the SAR image.</ul><li>Path planning (gimbal) <ul><li>Planning where the gimbal is pointing. E.g. wide-area-search</ul><li>Swarming algorithms<li>World-state awareness<li>Global self-awareness <ul><li>This means awareness of the platforms current extrinsics, velocity, how much fuel, capabilities, etc.</ul><li>Reasoning and prioritization <ul><li>Prioritization of <strong>tasks to perform</strong><li>Reasoning on <strong>how to perform each task</strong></ul><li>Natural language command + control</ul><h2 id=development>Development</h2><p>SME level: 90%<ul><li><code>mosh</code>: stands for "mobile shell". If you need to access a computer and make quick changes, usually use SSH. But that requires a persistent connection. With drones + radio, your comms are always in/out. <code>mosh</code> helps by keeping the session persistent, and sending back screen-caps of what you are doing.<li>Python, TensorRT, ONNX, etc. - Deep Learning Tools<li>Embedded software - Rust (good), C++ (good IFF expert, otherwise unsafe)</ul><h2 id=general-comments>General comments</h2><p>One thing that people often ask about is {insert company name here}. I'm not typing it because I don't want people to find it when searching. But this company has absolutely horrendous hardware, and absolutely horrendous software FOR "mission autonomy". However, they do have good "command + control" software.</div><br>
